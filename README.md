# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Project

This repo includes the following files:
•	'run_analysis.R': the script that performs the analyses to get the data set in 'tidy.txt'
•	'CodeBook.md' : a code book that describes the variables and summaries in 'tidy.txt'
•	'README.md': This file which  explains the analyses steps coded in 'run_analysis.R'
•	'tidy.txt': a text file output from 'run_analysis.R'

Data for the project is at:
•	https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

A full description of the project is at: 
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 

The purpose of the project is to create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 

   1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
   2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
   3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
   4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 

From the data set in step 4, create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The run_analysis.R script explains the analysis done in this project.
